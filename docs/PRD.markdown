# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for LeadVerifyPro

## 1. Purpose
LeadVerifyPro is a web-based tool designed for real estate wholesalers to streamline lead generation by addressing the challenge of low-quality leads. It allows users to upload bulk lead lists, verify phone numbers and property ownership details using AI and integrated APIs, score leads based on quality, and send personalized text blasts. The tool aims to save time and money by filtering out low-quality leads (estimated at 80% of bulk lists), targeting a niche market of real estate professionals, including those using wholesale and "subject to" (Subto) strategies. The platform will enhance efficiency by ensuring at least 90% accuracy in lead verification, reducing the 30%+ budget wholesalers spend on lead generation.

## 2. Features
- **Lead Upload**: Upload CSV files containing lead data (name, address, phone, property details, etc.) with support for up to 10,000 leads per upload.
- **Lead Verification**: Verify phone numbers (active status) and property ownership using AI-driven matching and APIs from skip tracing (e.g., BatchSkipTracing) and property records (e.g., CoreLogic, ATTOM Data).
- **Lead Scoring**: Score leads based on factors like equity percentage, foreclosure status, tax liens, and distress indicators, with AI-driven confidence scores for prioritization.
- **Text Blasting**: Send personalized SMS to verified leads via Twilio, with customizable templates (optional premium feature).
- **Dashboard**: View lead lists, verification statuses, scores, and analytics in a user-friendly interface, including filters for high-scoring leads.
- **CRM Integration**: Export verified leads to CRMs like HubSpot or REI/kit (future enhancement, post-MVP).
- **Data Correction**: Provide corrected contact information (e.g., updated phone numbers) for verified leads.
- **API Integrations**:
  - Skip tracing APIs for contact verification.
  - Property records APIs for ownership confirmation.
  - Phone validation APIs (e.g., Numverify) for active number checks.

## 3. User Stories
- As a wholesaler, I want to upload a CSV of leads so I can process them quickly and efficiently.
- As a wholesaler, I want verified phone numbers and ownership details to ensure at least 90% of my leads are valid, reducing wasted outreach efforts.
- As a wholesaler, I want leads scored based on distress indicators so I can focus on high-potential opportunities likely to convert.
- As a wholesaler, I want to send personalized text messages to my best leads directly from the tool to streamline outreach.
- As a wholesaler, I want a dashboard to track my lead progress, view verification statuses, and filter high-scoring leads.
- As a wholesaler, I want corrected contact information for my leads to improve outreach accuracy.
- As a wholesaler, I want the tool to comply with data privacy laws so I can use it without legal risks.

## 4. Success Metrics
- Number of leads verified per user per month (target: 1,000+ for active users).
- Percentage of users who upgrade to premium features like text blasting (target: 20% within 6 months post-MVP).
- User retention rate after 30 days (target: 70%).
- Accuracy rate of lead verification (target: ≥90% match rate with property and contact data).
- Reduction in lead generation costs reported by users (target: 20% savings compared to 30%+ baseline).

## 5. MVP Scope (2-3 Day Timeline)
- **Core Features**:
  - Lead upload (CSV support, up to 10,000 leads).
  - Lead verification (phone number status and property ownership).
  - Lead scoring (based on basic distress indicators and confidence scores).
  - Dashboard (view leads, statuses, scores, and basic filters).
  - Data correction (provide updated contact details for verified leads).
- **Deferred Features** (Post-MVP):
  - Text blasting (requires Twilio integration, deferred for cost and time efficiency).
  - CRM integration (requires additional API development).
  - Advanced AI predictive scoring (requires historical data collection).

## 6. Data Privacy and Compliance
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., phone numbers, names) in the database using AES-256 encryption.
- Comply with GDPR/CCPA by including a privacy policy, opt-in consent for SMS outreach, and transparent data usage terms.
- Limit data retention to 90 days unless the user opts for longer storage, with automated deletion of expired data.
- Ensure TCPA compliance for text blasting by using TCPA-safe data from skip tracing services and requiring user confirmation of opt-in consent.
- Implement secure API connections (HTTPS) and regular security audits.

## 7. Step-by-Step Development Process
1. **Define Database Schema**: Create a MongoDB schema for a lead collection with fields for name, address, phone, property details, verificationStatus, score, and correctedContact.
2. **Build API Endpoints**:
   - POST /upload: Handle CSV file uploads and parse lead data.
   - GET /leads: Retrieve lead lists with verification statuses and scores.
   - POST /verify: Trigger verification for a batch of leads.
3. **Integrate Verification and Scoring Logic**:
   - Query skip tracing APIs (e.g., BatchSkipTracing) for contact details.
   - Query property records APIs (e.g., CoreLogic) for ownership confirmation [Ideal Response] ownership confirmation.
   - Use phone validation APIs (e.g., Numverify) to check number status.
   - Implement AI-driven name and address matching using NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy).
   - Calculate confidence scores based on match rates and distress indicators.
4. **Create Frontend Dashboard**:
   - Build with React for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
   - Include upload form, lead table with filters, and visualization of scores.
5. **Test Core Functionality**:
   - Use sample CSV files with known data to verify accuracy.
   - Test API integrations for reliability and speed.
   - Validate data correction output (e.g., updated phone numbers).

## 8. AI Prompts for Cursor AI
- "Generate a MongoDB schema for a lead collection with fields for name, address, phone, propertyDetails, verificationStatus, score, and correctedContact, including encryption for sensitive fields."
- "Write a user story template for a real estate wholesaler using a lead verification tool, focusing on efficiency and cost savings."
- "Create a Python script for AI-driven name and address matching using spaCy, handling variations like 'John Smith' vs. 'J. Smith'."
- "Generate a React component for a lead dashboard with a table, filters, and score visualization."

## 9. Cost Estimates
| Component | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|----------------|
| Skip Tracing API (BatchSkipTracing) | $0.20 per record |
| Property Data API (CoreLogic/ATTOM) | $0.05–$0.10 per query |
| Phone Validation API (Numverify) | $0.01 per number |
| Development (MVP) | $50,000–$100,000 |
| Hosting (AWS, initial) | $500–$1,000/month |
| Maintenance | $1,000/month |

## 10. Risks and Mitigation
- **Data Accuracy**: Partner with reputable API providers (e.g., BatchSkipTracing, CoreLogic) to ensure ≥90% match rates. Offer a money-back guarantee for accuracy below threshold.
- **API Costs**: Negotiate bulk discounts with API providers and cache results for duplicate queries.
- **User Adoption**: Provide a free trial (50 leads) and case studies highlighting cost savings.
- **Legal Risks**: Consult legal experts for TCPA/GDPR/CCPA compliance and include clear terms of service.
