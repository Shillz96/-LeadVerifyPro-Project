# Comprehensive Market Research Report: AI-Powered Lead Verification for Wholesale Real Estate

## Executive Summary
Wholesale real estate, including strategies like "subject to" (Subto) financing, relies heavily on lead generation to identify distressed or off-market properties. However, wholesalers face significant challenges, spending over 30% of their budget on leads, with only about 20% being viable due to inaccurate contact information or mismatched property ownership. This report explores the feasibility of a proposed AI-powered website to verify and filter lead lists, enhancing efficiency for wholesalers. By integrating with skip tracing services and property records databases, and leveraging AI for data matching and predictive scoring, the platform can address these pain points. Market analysis indicates a gap for such a specialized service, with opportunities to target wholesalers through niche marketing channels.

## Understanding Wholesale and Subto Real Estate
### Wholesale Real Estate
Wholesale real estate involves securing a contract on a property, typically distressed or off-market, at a below-market price and selling that contract to another investor for a profit without taking ownership ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/what-goal-real-estate-wholesaling.asp)). Wholesalers target properties needing repairs or owned by motivated sellers facing financial distress, divorce, or inheritance issues. The process requires identifying leads, contacting owners, and negotiating contracts quickly.

### Subto Real Estate
"Subject to" (Subto) real estate is a creative financing strategy where an investor acquires a property by taking over the existing mortgage payments, with the title transferring to the investor while the loan remains in the seller’s name ([Patten Title Company](https://pattentitle.com/blog-posts/investors/what-is-subject-to-real-estate/)). This approach benefits sellers facing financial difficulties and investors avoiding traditional financing. Influencers like Pace Morby, known for his Subto community, have popularized this strategy ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/08/01/subject-to-contracts-the-simple-guide-for-real-estate-investors/)).

### Lead Generation Challenges
Wholesalers purchase bulk lead lists containing property addresses, owner names, and contact information, often sourced from public records or data providers. These lists target indicators of distress, such as pre-foreclosures or tax liens. However, only about 20% of leads are viable due to:
- **Non-working phone numbers**: Invalid or disconnected numbers.
- **Incorrect person**: The listed contact is not the property owner.
- **Mismatched property ownership**: The person does not own the specified property.

This low viability rate results in significant time and cost inefficiencies, with wholesalers spending over 30% of their budget on lead generation.

## Proposed Solution: AI-Powered Lead Verification Website
### Concept Overview
The proposed website allows wholesalers to upload lead lists (e.g., CSV files) and uses AI to verify and filter them, identifying high-quality leads that are accurate and likely to convert. The platform addresses the three main issues:
1. Verifying if phone numbers are active.
2. Confirming the contact is the correct person.
3. Ensuring they own the specified property.

By integrating with external data sources and employing AI for data processing, the website aims to improve lead quality and reduce wasted resources.

### Technical Implementation
#### Data Sources and Integration
The website requires integration with reliable data sources to verify lead information:
- **Property Records Databases**: To confirm ownership, the platform can use services like CoreLogic, ATTOM Data, or PropStream, which aggregate county-level property records. These provide current owner names and property details.
- **Skip Tracing Services**: Services like [BatchSkipTracing](https://batchskiptracing.com/api) provide accurate contact information for property owners, including phone numbers and emails. Their API can verify or correct lead list data.
- **Phone Number Validation**: Tools like Twilio or Numverify can check if phone numbers are active and valid.
- **Reverse Phone Lookup**: Services like Whitepages or Spokeo can confirm if a phone number is associated with the listed owner, though privacy regulations must be considered.
- **Distress Indicators**: Data on pre-foreclosures, tax liens, or high-equity properties can be sourced from foreclosure listing services or public records to prioritize motivated sellers.

#### AI and Data Processing
AI enhances the verification process in several ways:
- **Data Cleaning and Matching**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques handle variations in names or addresses (e.g., "John Smith" vs. "J. Smith") for accurate matching with property records.
- **Verification Logic**: The platform compares lead list data with external sources, flagging leads where owner names and contact details match.
- **Predictive Scoring**: As the platform collects data on lead outcomes (e.g., which leads convert to deals), machine learning models can predict high-potential leads based on features like property type, location, or financial indicators.
- **Automation**: AI automates querying multiple data sources, cross-referencing information, and generating confidence scores for each lead.

#### Workflow Example
1. **Upload**: A user uploads a CSV file with columns for property address, owner name, and phone number.
2. **Property Verification**: The platform queries a property records database to confirm the current owner.
3. **Contact Verification**: It uses skip tracing to retrieve accurate contact details and phone validation to check number status.
4. **Matching**: AI matches the lead’s owner name and contact info with retrieved data, assigning a confidence score.
5. **Output**: The user receives a filtered list of verified leads, with corrected contact information and scores indicating quality.

#### Initial vs. Advanced Features
- **Initial Version**: Focus on rule-based verification using skip tracing and property records, providing corrected contact details and confidence scores.
- **Advanced Version**: Incorporate machine learning for predictive scoring, requiring historical data on lead outcomes collected via user feedback (e.g., marking leads as “contacted” or “converted”).

### Market Analysis
#### Existing Solutions
- **General Lead Verification**: Services like [Accurate Append](https://accurateappend.com/lead-validation/) offer email and phone verification but lack real estate-specific features like property ownership checks.
- **Real Estate Lead Generation**: Tools like PropStream and BatchLeads provide property data and skip tracing but focus on generating leads rather than verifying existing lists.
- **Specialized Verification**: [Verified Real Estate Leads](https://verifiedrealestateleads.com/) verifies leads for agents via a “TRIFECTA” process (phone, text, email), but it targets buyers/sellers, not wholesalers seeking distressed properties.

The proposed website fills a gap for a service tailored to verifying wholesale lead lists, focusing on ownership and distress indicators.

#### Competitive Advantage
- **Specialization**: Unlike general verification services, the platform is designed for wholesalers, addressing their unique needs.
- **AI Integration**: Advanced data matching and future predictive scoring differentiate it from rule-based tools.
- **Corrected Data**: Providing accurate contact information enhances lead usability.
- **User Experience**: A simple interface for uploading lists and receiving results, with clear scoring explanations, ensures accessibility.

#### Market Size and Opportunity
Wholesalers, including those using Subto strategies, form a significant segment of real estate investors. With high lead generation costs and low conversion rates, a tool that improves efficiency is likely to attract users. The success of influencers like Pace Morby, who has trained over 3,500 students via his Subto platform ([Wikitia](https://www.wikitia.com/wiki/Pace_Morby)), indicates a growing community of wholesalers seeking innovative solutions.
