## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend API Alignment (Completed)

1. **Core API Endpoints Implemented**
   - Implemented `/api/leads` endpoints for lead management
   - Implemented `/api/users/me` for account settings
   - Implemented basic `/api/reports` endpoints
   - Added proper error handling for all endpoints

2. **Authentication Middleware Implemented**
   - All protected routes use proper JWT authentication
   - Added role-based access control

3. **AI Services Integration**
   - Implemented computer vision routes
   - Implemented NLP document analysis routes
   - Implemented ML scoring routes
   - Added proper error handling for all AI services

### Phase 2: Frontend Alignment

1. **Update Error Handling**
   - Properly handle API errors in frontend components
   - Show meaningful error messages to users
   - Added retry mechanisms for AI service failures

2. **Implement Loading States**
   - Added loading indicators for all API calls
   - Improved user experience during data fetching
   - Added progressive loading for AI analysis results

3. **Add New AI Components**
   - Implemented PropertyInsights component
   - Implemented MotivationScoreGauge component
   - Added NeighborhoodTrendsMap visualization
   - Created PropertyConditionCard component

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification

1. **API Integration Testing**
   - Test all frontend-backend integrations
   - Verify that data flows correctly between components
   - Ensure proper error handling for service failures

2. **Navigation Testing**
   - Click through all navigation elements
   - Ensure no 404 errors are encountered

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test error scenarios (server down, network issues)
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

## Maintenance Plan

1. **Regular Route Audits**
   - Review frontend routes monthly
   - Check for dead links or missing pages

2. **API Documentation Updates**
   - Keep API documentation in sync with implementation
   - Document any changes to endpoints or parameters

3. **Coming Soon Page Management**
   - Remove "Coming Soon" pages as features are implemented
   - Update estimated release dates as needed

4. **AI Service Monitoring**
   - Monitor performance of AI services
   - Track usage metrics and adjust capacity as needed
   - Update AI models based on accuracy metrics

## Conclusion

By implementing this plan, we ensure all backend services are aligned with the frontend, including the new AI-powered features. The integration of AI services through well-defined routes enables a seamless user experience with property insights, scoring, and analysis capabilities. The "Coming Soon" page approach provides users with feedback about planned features while avoiding broken experiences.
