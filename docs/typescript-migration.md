# TypeScript Migration Guide

This document outlines the migration process from JavaScript to TypeScript for the LeadVerifyPro backend.

## Current Status (Summary)

The backend has been significantly refactored to prioritize TypeScript. Key JavaScript files like `server.js` and `middleware/auth.js` now primarily act as loaders for their compiled TypeScript counterparts in the `dist` directory. Environment variable handling has been made more secure and robust, especially for production deployments.

## Completed Changes (Recent Key Updates)

-   ✅ **TypeScript Prioritization**: `backend/server.js` and `backend/middleware/auth.js` have been updated to remove legacy JavaScript fallbacks. They now exclusively attempt to load the compiled TypeScript versions from the `dist` directory and will cause the application to exit if these are not found or if the auth module doesn't export a function.
-   ✅ **Secure Environment Configuration (`backend/src/config/env.ts`)**:
    *   Hardcoded `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` removed from `backend/vercel.json`.
    *   `backend/src/config/env.ts` now enforces strict checks in `production` mode:
        *   Application will **exit** if `MONGO_URI` or `JWT_SECRET` are undefined.
        *   Application will **exit** if `JWT_SECRET` uses the default insecure development key.
    *   Fallback URIs/secrets are only used in non-production environments if specific variables are not set.
-   ✅ **Robust Database Connection (`backend/config/database.js`)**:
    *   Now uses `MONGO_URI` from the centrally managed and validated `config` object.
    *   Connection options (pool size, timeouts) adjusted for better production performance.
    *   Increased retry attempts for database connection.
    *   More detailed logging for production connection failures.
-   ✅ Created `/src/middleware/auth.ts` with proper TypeScript support
-   ✅ Created `/src/routes/adminRoutes.ts` with TypeScript implementation
-   ✅ Fixed imports in `leadController.ts` for error handlers
-   ✅ Fixed type issues in `LeadInputData` interface to include 'phone' and 'user' properties
-   ✅ Fixed import conflicts in `subscriptionController.ts`
-   ✅ Updated routes index to use TypeScript versions of routes
-   ✅ Created TypeScript rate limiting middleware
-   ✅ Fixed the JavaScript versions to properly export middleware functions
-   ✅ Added example environment variables file

## Remaining Migration Tasks

-   [ ] Migrate remaining JavaScript models to TypeScript (e.g., `User.js`, `Lead.js` if not already done)
-   [ ] Migrate remaining JavaScript controllers to TypeScript
-   [ ] Migrate `backend/config/database.js` to TypeScript (`backend/src/config/database.ts`)
-   [ ] Migrate remaining JavaScript middleware to TypeScript (if any)
-   [ ] Migrate remaining JavaScript routes to TypeScript (if any)
-   [ ] Migrate utility functions in `backend/utils` to TypeScript
-   [ ] Update/add tests for TypeScript compatibility across all backend modules.
-   [ ] Ensure proper error handling throughout the codebase using TypeScript best practices.

## Deployment Checklist (Render - Backend)

1.  **Environment Variables (Set in Render Dashboard)**:
    *   `NODE_ENV` = `production`
    *   `MONGO_URI` = Your MongoDB Atlas production connection string (e.g., `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.../db`)
    *   `JWT_SECRET` = A strong, unique JWT secret for production (NOT the default dev key).
    *   `PORT` (Render usually injects this; ensure your app uses `process.env.PORT`)
    *   Any other required API keys (e.g., `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`).

2.  **Build Command (Render Settings)**:
    ```bash
    npm install && npm run build
    ```
    *(Ensures dependencies are installed and TypeScript is compiled to the `dist` directory via `tsc` specified in `package.json`'s `build` script.)*

3.  **Start Command (Render Settings)**:
    ```bash
    node dist/server.js
    ```
    *(Or `npm start` if your `package.json` start script points to `node dist/server.js` or `node server.js` and `server.js` correctly loads `dist/server.js`)*

## Recommendations for Future Development

1.  **Type Definitions**: Continue creating/using a dedicated `types` or `interfaces` directory/namespace for shared TypeScript types and interfaces.
2.  **Controller Structure**: Standardize controller methods using `asyncHandler` and clear patterns for auth, validation, logic, and response, as previously recommended.
3.  **Error Handling**: Consistently use the centralized error handling middleware and custom error classes throughout the TypeScript codebase.
4.  **Tests**: Prioritize writing unit and integration tests for all new and migrated TypeScript components.

## Common TypeScript Migration Issues (Reiteration)

1.  **Import Paths**: Double-check relative import paths, especially `../` vs `./`, after compilation from `src` to `dist`.
2.  **Type Definitions**: Ensure all external libraries have their `@types/package-name` installed from `devDependencies`.
3.  **`any` type**: Minimize usage of `any`. Define specific types/interfaces where possible.
4.  **Null/Undefined Handling**: Leverage TypeScript's strict null checks (`strictNullChecks: true` in `tsconfig.json` is recommended) and handle potential null/undefined values explicitly.

## Common TypeScript Migration Issues

1. **Import Paths**: Be careful with relative import paths in TypeScript, especially after compilation

2. **Type Definitions**: Ensure all external libraries have type definitions (@types/package-name)

3. **Interface Consistency**: Maintain consistent interfaces between frontend and backend

4. **Null Checking**: TypeScript is more strict about null/undefined checks
