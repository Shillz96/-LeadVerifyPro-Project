# High-Fidelity Mockups for LeadVerifyPro

## Overview
These mockups describe the visual design of key pages, created as if in Figma, using Magic UI components and a modern, AI-centric aesthetic. The design elevates LeadVerifyPro to a premium experience with sophisticated animations, thoughtful micro-interactions, and layered depth effects that create a sense of luxury and intelligence.

## Enhanced Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**: Sage Green (#A8B5A2), Dusty Rose (#DCAE96), Navy Blue (#1F2A44), Burnt Orange (#CC5500), Creamy Ivory (#F1EDEB), Slate Gray (#708090), Mustard Yellow (#E1AD01), Lavender (#B57EDC).
- **Usage**: Use Sage Green for primary actions and success messages, Dusty Rose for secondary buttons, Navy Blue for headers and footers, Burnt Orange for accent lines, Creamy Ivory for page backgrounds, Slate Gray for body text, Mustard Yellow for notification badges, and Lavender for focus rings.
- **Gradient Overlays**: Implement subtle gradient transitions between complementary colors to add depth and sophistication.
- **Color Transitions**: Colors shift subtly based on scroll position and user interactions to create a dynamic, responsive feel.

## Enhanced Visual Elements
- **Backgrounds**: Introduce gradient overlays and subtle textures inspired by Zen Browser, with grain textures that add tactile quality.
- **Shadows and Corners**: Use soft, layered shadows and variable rounded corners for a friendly yet premium interface.
- **3D Elements**: Add subtle depth with layered components that respond to scroll and mouse movement.
- **Parallax Effects**: Implement gentle parallax on key sections to create immersive depth.

## Interactive Elements
- **Micro-interactions**: Implement subtle scaling, color changes, and position shifts on hover for all interactive elements.
- **Custom Cursors**: Design context-aware cursors that change based on the element being hovered.
- **Magic UI Components**: Enhance Bento Grid and Animated List with 3D perspective and staggered animations.
- **Transition States**: Design elegant loading, success, and error states for all user actions.

## Responsive Design
- **Breakpoints**: Ensure full responsiveness with clear breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Gesture Interactions**: Implement swipe, pinch, and other gesture controls for mobile users.
- **Animation Optimization**: Scale down animation complexity on mobile for performance while maintaining premium feel.

## AI-Driven Features

## Notes
- All pages implement smooth scrolling (CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`) with scroll-linked animations and parallax effects.
- Custom cursor effects change based on interactive elements (e.g., pointer on buttons, grab on scrollable areas).
- Micro-animations on all interactive elements provide immediate feedback and create a sense of responsiveness.
- Page transitions use GSAP or Framer Motion for liquid-smooth navigation between routes.
- 3D depth achieved through layered elements, perspective transforms, and parallax effects.
- Variable font weights used where possible to create subtle typography animations.
- Responsive: Desktop (1200px+), tablet (768â€“1200px), mobile (<768px) with adjusted animations and gesture controls.
- Animations: Primary transitions (0.3s), entrance animations (0.5-0.8s), with appropriate easing functions for natural movement.
